### Hi there 👋 

✨ I'm <b>Grace</b>, 

<p>I've dabbled in marketing, model management, <a href="http://www.gracelauphoto.com">photography</a>, startups, & tech recruiting.</p>
  <p>I've also dabbled in coding, UX and have a passion for ideation of products. </p>
  <p> I love talking about tech, startups, and anything in the innovation space. </p>
  <p>I am firm believer that <b> all</b> your experiences shape who you are and <b>all skills</b> are <strong>transferable</strong> skills. </p>
<p>I love meeting new people and seeing what they are looking for and where they want to go.</p>

⚡ Fun fact: I am a self taught photograper who decided I wanted to be able to shoot photos that looked like the ones I saw in magazines 
  
 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code again after a 4 year hiatus 👩🏻‍💻
